## Veejay is a Visual Instrument

*a 'visual' instrument and realtime video sampler (for live video improvisation)*

It allows you to "play" the video like you would play a piano

While playing, you can record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling), all effects are realtime and optimized for use on modern processors, Veejay likes the sound of your video's as much as their images: sound is kept in sync ( pitched when needed - trickplay) and delivered to JACK for possible further processing.

You can cluster to allow a number of machines to work together over the network (uncompressed streaming, veejay chaining) And much more...

The engine is historically based upon mjpegtools's lavplay and processes all video in YUV planar It performs at its best, currently with MJPEG AVI (through ffmpeg/libav) or one of veejay's internal formats. Veejay is built upon a servent architecture.

### Veejay Applications:
* __Reloaded__
    A GUI developed in GLADE/GTK ([veejay-client](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/veejay-client))
* __sendVIMS__
    A PureData object allowing direct communications with the server ([sendVIMS](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/sendVIMS))
* __sayVIMS__
    A console based utility for quick'n'dirty scripting ([veejay-utils](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/veejay-utils))

And of course [__Veejay__](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/veejay-server) himself ! The video output server (Ffmpeg/libSDL). Could be remote, headless, multiples ... !

## Installation

#### Get all the dependencies
First, make sure you system is up-to-date, and install the dependencies with:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git autoconf automake libtool m4 gcc libjpeg62-dev \
libswscale-dev libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libx11-dev  \
gtk-3.0-dev libxml2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libjack0 libjack-dev jackd1
```

#### Build the veejay's applications

Veejay is divided into multiple packages. Each must be build separately and in a specific order. 

1. [veejay-server](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/veejay-server)
2. [reloaded-gtk3](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/reloaded-gtk3) or [veejay-client](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/veejay-client) for GTK2
3. [veejay-utils](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/veejay-utils)
4. [plugin-packs](https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/plugin-packs)

For __each package__, run the triptich commands of the *GNU build system* (for a quick start you can build the first two):

```bash
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure
 make && sudo make install
```
 __Nota :__ in some configuration you should have to __manually build__ the __shared libraries cache__ just after the __first__ veejay-server installation (ex `sudo ldconfig` or similar)

You do not need to pass any parameters to `./configure` for veejay to be optimized with the current cpu-type.
If you want to build for a specific architecture or without sound support (jack) ... take a look to the
`./configure --help` to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Before running veejay, be sure to add or link some TrueType fonts in 

    $HOME/.veejay/fonts

## Usage

Running veejay is a much too large topic to cover in this readme. Various
pointers have been bundled with the sources in [veejay/veejay-current/veejay-server/doc](./veejay-current/veejay-server/doc)

Articles covering various aspects of "how to veejay" can be found on [veejayhq.net](http://veejayhq.net)

But the quick answer would be:

### 1. Start one or more Veejay servers:

```
veejay --clip-as-sample my-movie-A.avi
veejay -p 4490 -g my-movie-B.avi
```

### 2. Start and autoconnect the veejay graphical interface:

```
reloaded -a
```

## Building/Configuring plugins

There are several plugin-packs available for veejay: https://github.com/c0ntrol/veejay/tree/master/veejay-current/plugin-packs 

* lvdcrop ; a couple of crop filters and a port of frei0r's scale0tilt 
* lvdshared ; a couple of plugins that implement a producer/consumer mechanism for shared video resources
* lvdgmic ; GMIC based filters, although slow in processing they are quite amazing

To compile and install a plugin-pack:
```bash
cd plugin-packs/lvdgmic
./autogen.sh
./configure && make 
```

Veejay looks in a few common locations to find plugins:
* /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1
* /usr/lib/frei0r-1
* /usr/lib64/frei0r-1

You can list more locations in $HOME/.veejay/plugins.cfg

You can change the default parameter values by editing the files in $HOME/.veejay/frei0r/ and $HOME/.veejay/livido/

## Debugging

if you want to debug veejay-server (or if you want to submit a meaningful backtrace), build with:

     ./configure --enable-debug
