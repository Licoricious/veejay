Title: Custom GtkWidgets using GtkCairo

Abstract:

Cairo is a vector graphics library with cross-device output support. There are
plans for basing either the next generation, gtk+ or gnome canvas on cairo. One
of the existing prototypes gtk+/Cairo integration is GtkCairo.

In this talk, I'll give an introduction to programming with Cairo's imaging 
model, focusing specially on issues relating to integration with gtk+, and 
deriving GtkWidgets using GtkCairo, maintaing a consistent look and feel with 
the rest of the gtk+ widget set. During the presentation I will demonstrate code
and usage of both simple and advanced GtkCairo widgets.

How cairo eventually will be integrated with gtk+/gnome in the future isn't quite
sure yet, but Cairo's base API won't change, thus code created using GtkCairo; will
easily be adopted to future interfaces.
