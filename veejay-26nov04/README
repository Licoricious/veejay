Veejay - Video Mixing/Editing Instrument
========================================

Note:

    This is a re-structured version of veejay (fork of the CVS version)
    Some parts of the howto/man pages may be outdated, but in general it should be the same.
    See the ChangeLog file for recent changes (compared to 0.6.0 CVS)
    Also, this release doesnt include a GTK gui. 
    With luck (no promises, I am *very* busy with other stuff), You can expect one in early March 
    (including a experimental multi-track pattern editor)

Note2:
    This release picks up ffmpeg from CVS and builds it at configure time.
    In future versions, 'make' will take care of this but now its like this.

============

Must have:

    XML library for Gnome

	http://www.libsdl.org

	http://libdv.sourceforge.net

    DirectFB (for output on secundary head/TV-Out)

QUICK OVERVIEW
==============

Read the HOWTO if you a new user , see doc/veejay-HOWTO.html 

Use the console command '?' , 'H' or 'h' to see a list
of options , use the keyboard (with mouse pointer on your SDL video window) to
use the keys. 

To see a list of key events, type 'man veejay' in your shell or try 
'cat veejay/vj-event.c |grep SDLK' for a more up to date version.        

For users with Intel Pentium 4 processors with Hyper Threading, benefit
if they enable SMP in their kernel 2.6.x  


PLUGINS
=======

 As of version 0.6.3 , veejay supports a plugin architecture for pull/push plugins.


INSTALLING
===========

    In general, ./configure && make && make install if you meet 
    all requirements.
    
    

Running Veejay
==============

Start the core with
	
'veejay <options> <filename 1 ,... , filename N>'

examples:

1. have a small SDL window (for the keybindings) and DirectFB:

   'veejay -O2 -S171x144 /video/video.avi'


2. run veejay without a video file

   (not anymore)
