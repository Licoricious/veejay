Veejay - Video Mixing/Editing Instrument
========================================

Important:
----------
This version of veejay is not compatible with any earlier versions.

 
See:
	README.quickstart
	README.performance
	doc/veejay-HOWTO.html
	doc/NET.txt
	doc/VIMS.txt
	doc/YCbCr.txt
	doc/COPYING	

Tips:	    
=====

To see a list of all default keyboard events, type 'man veejay' in your shell or try 
'cat veejay/vj-event.c |grep SDLK' for a more up to date version.        

For users with Intel Pentium 4 processors with Hyper Threading, benefit
if they enable SMP in their kernel 2.6.x  

Since version 0.6.3, veejay doesnt have a console interface anymore!!!
Use 'sayVIMS -i' to enter interactive mode and give '?' or 'h' 
to see a list of commands, or simply type VIMS style messages.

Starting of version 0.8, Veejay has a graphical user interface GVeejay
which is distributed with this package. 
The quickest way to start with Veejay is by launching gveejay.
(No user manual on Gveejay yet).

PLUGINS
=======

As of version 0.6.3 , veejay supports a plugin architecture for pull/push plugins.
libvje (veejay's effects) is obsolete, port to vevo is planned.


NETWORK
=======

As of version 0.7.2 , network support is complete (incl. streaming video)
and more advanced (OSC and VIMS multicast) possibilities.


INSTALLING
===========

    In general, ./configure && make && make install if you meet 
    all requirements.
    

Running Veejay
==============

Start the core with
	
'veejay <options> <filename 1 ,... , filename N>'

examples:
