Tips:	    
=====

To see a list of key events, type 'man veejay' in your shell or try 
'cat veejay/vj-event.c |grep SDLK' for a more up to date version.        

For users with Intel Pentium 4 processors with Hyper Threading, benefit
if they enable SMP in their kernel 2.6.x  

Since version 0.6.3, veejay doesnt have a console interface anymore!!!
Use 'sayVIMS -i' to enter interactive mode and give '?' or 'h' 
to see a list of commands, or simply type VIMS style messages.


PLUGINS
=======

As of version 0.6.3 , veejay supports a plugin architecture for pull/push plugins.
libvje (veejay's effects) is obsolete, port to vevo is planned.


NETWORK
=======

As of version 0.7.2 , network support is complete (incl. streaming video)
and more advanced (OSC and VIMS multicast) possibilities.


INSTALLING
===========

    In general, ./configure && make && make install if you meet 
    all requirements.
    

Running Veejay
==============

Start the core with
	
'veejay <options> <filename 1 ,... , filename N>'

examples:

1. have a small SDL window (for the keybindings) and DirectFB:

   'veejay -O2 -S171x144 /video/video.avi'


2. run veejay without a video file

	veejay -d -W <width> -H <height> -R <framerate>
