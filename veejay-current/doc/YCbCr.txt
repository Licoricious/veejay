Veejay processing
=================


	Veejay processes nativly in YUV, hence no RGB <-> YUV conversions 
        are used while rendering.

		YUV 4:2:0 Planar ( 1 Cr and 1 Cb sample per 2x2 Y samples)
		YUV 4:2:2 Planar ( 1 Cr and 1 Cr sample per 1x2 Y samples)  
		(both full range JPEG and clipped to 16-235 / 16-240)
	


	Conversion from RGB to YUV is only necessary for webcam devices.
	Conversion from YUV to RGB is only necessary for preview image


Why YUV ?
=========

	- Many video codecs decode into some YUV flavour
	- Many capture devices deliver YUV 
	- Software conversion of RGB <-> YUV is expensive
	- Consumes less bandwith then RGB
