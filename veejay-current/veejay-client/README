                :: Reloaded, a graphical interface for Veejay ::


	FEATURE OVERVIEW


General:

 # Thin client (TCP/IP)
 # MIDI support (auto learning)
 # Slick interface designed for live performing
 # Tracks multiple veejay servers

Install
=======

See file 'INSTALL'

See veejay-server/doc/Installation.md
See veejay-server/doc/HOWTO.compile.md
See veejay-server/doc/Howto_Compile_on_Ubuntu.html

Documentation
=============

$ reloaded --help

See source code.

Running
=======

Autoconnect with default theme and small as possible user interface
-------------------------------------

$ reloaded -a -t default -S

Connect a MIDI controller
-------------------------

To use a midi controller with veejay you must connect
the veejay's sequencer port to the MIDI controller port.
There is a utility 'aconnect' (comes with ALSA) that does this.

1. Launch reloaded
  $ reloaded -a

2. List inputs (midi keyboards)
  $ aconnect -i

  client 129: 'Virtual Keyboard' [type=user]

3. List outputs (Veejay via reloaded)
  $ aconnect -o

  client 128: 'Veejay' [type=user]

4. Connect the ports

  $ aconnect 129 128

5. Check the connection between your controler and reloaded

  $ aconnect -l


Now, from the menu, you must select MIDI learn mode in order to create your setup.
Follow the help messages in the reloaded status bar to proceed.

Once you have finish your setup, from the menu, enable MIDI ... and done!
You can now control veejay via reloaded via your MIDI controler.

With -m / --midi command line parameter, you can start reloaded with a MIDI
configuration file (layout) of a previous saved setup.
