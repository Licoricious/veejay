Description:Veejay a visual instrument and realtime video sampler.
 With veejay, you can play the video like you would play a piano. The
 engine is based upon ffmpeg and the mjpegtools featuring a client-server
 model with multiple clients.
 .
 Veejay boasts the following powerfull features.
 .
 While playing, you can record the resulting video directly to disk 
 (video sampling).
 .
 All effects are realtime and optimized for use on modern processors.
 .
 Veejay likes the sound of your videos as much as their images: sound is
 kept in sync (pitched when needed - trickplay) and delivered to JACK for
 possible further processing.
 .
 Can cluster to allow a number of machines to work together over the
 network (uncompressed streaming, veejay chaining).
 .
 And much more...
