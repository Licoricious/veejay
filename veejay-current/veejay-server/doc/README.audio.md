AUDIO support
-------------

Veejay has limited audio support aka no fancy effects on sound. Despite that,
veejay will keep in sync the audio channel's of your clip, and transport it trough
[JACK - jackaudio.org](http://jackaudio.org/) a famous and robust low latency audio server.


Prepare
-------

You need an AVI file with an audio track encoded in signed PCM WAVE, 44-48Khz, 2 channels (stereo) (16 bit)

For example with ffmpeg/avconv you can use the "PCM signed 16-bit little-endian" codec named "pcm_s16le"

    $Â ffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -q:v 1 -vcodec mjpeg -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48000 -s 1024x576 myvideo.avi


Run
---

Veejay only has support for jackd1 (the old jack).

### Start Jack audio

From terminal command, start `jackd` prior to starting `veejay` :

    $ jackd -dalsa -P -r48000

__Important__ : Jack audio server must be configured with the same sampling rate
as the loaded video files. Consequently, all your video __files must have the same sampling rate__.

* 44khz audio files using `-r44100` into the previous command line
* 48khz audio files using `-r48000`

(An alternative to this to use the `qjackctl` graphical user interface)

### Now, start veejay

    $ veejay -m80 /path/to/myvideo.avi

Use the `-m` commandline option to allow veejay to cache video frames when sampling. This will reduce disk latency,
allowing for smoother audio playback (especially when used in combination of speed/pitch changes)

The `-m` commandline option is further explained in [README memory](./README.memory.md)

__Nota__ : The video you start veejay with must contains a sound stream, else the jack transport is not started ... even if `-a` option.

Audio playback problems
-----------------------

Q: What can I do about the warning "Rendering audio/video frame takes too long (measured 44 ms). Can't keep pace with audio!" 


A(1): You can start veejay with the -m commandline option. The warnings are less frequent or dissapear when the whole sample is cached in memory.

A(2): You can disable veejay's multithreaded pixel operations:
  
    $ export VEEJAY_MULTITHREAD_TASKS=0
    $ veejay -m80 /path/to/mjpeg.avi

A(3): Have a dedicated veejay-server machine and connect with reloaded through the network

A(4): Run with a different video codec or lower the video resolution
