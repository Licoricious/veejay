For security reasons:

1) veejay has no concept of authentication, authorization or access management
2) everyone can quit veejay by sending "600:;" using sayVIMS
3) everyone can connect with reloaded to any other veejay in the network
4) many routines in veejay's event manager are not safe for buffer exploits
5) you should firewall the veejay ports on IP basis, if you want to have some minimal security
